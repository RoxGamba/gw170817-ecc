# GW170817_ecc
Notes and scripts for gw170817_ecc analysis

## Summary
* From Axel's injections we have seen that eccentricity can strongly bias the recovery of the chirp mass of BNS signals
* as a consequence, this can also impact the recovery of the effective tidal parameter $\tilde\Lambda$
* What happens for GW170817? 

## Preliminary Studies
* Axel's injection (to be added)
* Quasi-circular vs Eccentric tidal effects: $\Delta\phi^{T, ecc} - \Delta\phi^{T, QC} \sim 0.2$ rad. at 1500 Hz
